You have some information from a user in JSON format, including their name, email, and message. Your job is to:
Convert this JSON text into a JavaScript object.
Write a named arrow function that tries to print "Message received from <name>".
If something goes wrong (like the JSON is broken), show an error message.
Run the function to show the result in the console.

         let txt={"name": "inshana","email":"abuc@gmail.com","message":"hello guys"};
         
         let shwmsg = () =>{
            try {
               let  user=JSON.parse(txt);
               console.log(msg received &{txt.name});
            }
            catch(err){
               console.err("Error:Invalid")
            }
         };
 shwmsg();
